Computer Setup
-----------------------

Before your first workshop or class, you'll need to setup your computer. This means you will need to download and install all the tools necessary to write code. These guides may contain a lot of terms that you are unfamiliar with. Bear with us, follow along, and see if you can set up your computer so that you're fully ready to go for the workshop. 

**If you encounter any problems with these guides, please come in a half-hour early to your workshop or class so that we can help you setup your computer.**

### Setup

##### 1. Ensure your laptop is up to the task of coding

  - Is virus and malware free
  - Uses the latest, stable, updated version of its operating system
  - Has a functioning screen, keyboard, and trackpad
  - Has plenty of free hard drive space and memory
  - Can reliably connect to wireless networks

##### 2. Sign up for a GitHub account

Head on over to https://github.com/ and sign up. (It's free!, there is no cost for a developer account)

##### 3. Complete the setup guide for your computer's operating system

Based on your type of computer, follow the following instructions:

  - [Mac OS X](prework/mac/1_terminal.md)

  - [Windows](prework/windows/1_terminal.md)

### Checklist

Following completion of the setup work, you should:
- Have a GitHub account
